<p id = "first_p">The mausoleum was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mamtaz Mahal.
        It is one of the Seven Wonders of the entire world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well.
        The mausoleum is made entirely in white marble and there is inlaid work.
        The huge building had real gemstones encrusted in the walls, which were later pillaged by intruders and invaders.
        The words of the Holy Quran are engraved on the walls while in the center of the mausoleum, the empress and the emperor lay side by side in eternal peace.
        The grand entrance is in itself a sight to behold. It is one of the best places for top sightseeing in Agra.
